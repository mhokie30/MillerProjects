1. Install dependancies & Other prerequisites:
  - Install Python
  - Install FFmpeg
  - pip install transformers
  - pip install pyaudio
  - pip install pyserial
  - pip install openai-whisper
  - pip install hf_xet
  

If you have an error these are some common issues:

1. You may have the dependancy "serial" installed which can created errors with my code as "import serial" is the same with serial and pyserial. If you have this issue just pip uninstall serial -y and then install pyserial
2. Same thing for pyaudio or openai-whisper. There is a whisper library that you might have to uninstall and then install openai-whisper for this to work correctly. 

2. Upload python code to your IDE:

Make sure that your COM port is correct



3. Upload code to Arduino IDE and upload it to your device
