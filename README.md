# Voice-to-Text Assistant Project

# Project Overview
This project is a voice controlled assistant built with Arduino. It listens to user input, converts speech to text, and provides options to summarize, translate, or create notes from the input. The goal is to explore how voice recognition can interface with embedded systems and how NLP's can enhance productivity.

# Required Items / Hardware
- Arduino board
- USB cable for programming
- Microphone module compatible with Arduino
- Optional: Speakers for audio feedback
- Computer for running speech-to-text and processing code

# Required Accounts / Software
- Arduino IDE (for programming the board)
- Python (for voice processing scripts)
- Speech-to-text API (OpenAI Whisper)
- Optional: Hugging Face account (for NLP tasks like summarization or translation)

# How It Works
1. The microphone captures voice input.
2. Arduino forwards the audio data to a connected computer or module.
3. Speech-to-text software converts the audio into text.
4. The user selects an action: summarize, translate, or make notes.
5. The processed output is returned either as text on-screen or stored in a file.

# Future Improvements
- Implement offline speech recognition for faster response.
- Add text-to-speech output for a fully interactive assistant.
- Integrate more languages and advanced NLP features.
